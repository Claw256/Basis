# Philosophy of Basis

## What is Basis?

The simple answer is short. Basis is anything you want it to be, minus the hard foundational work that limits your creativity or agency.

Want to make a game? Focus on the art and gameplay.

Want to hold an event? Build the venue.

Feel overwhelmed by the technical demands of VR but have an idea you want to make real? Use Basis to help you do that. Use it as a starting point to build what you want.

### Technically...?

Basis is a **set of libraries** designed to help you bootstrap your VR projects. Basis is also a **demo** demonstrating how these components work together.

It is built on top of Unity and C#, and the demo in particular makes use of the Universal Rendering Pipeline (URP) for rendering, and targets IL2CPP.

## Who is Basis for?

The simple answer: creators who want to bypass a lot of the core work needed to bring up a VR game at all.

In principle, there are three major building blocks necessary for a good VR experience.

- **Presence**: The feeling, based on your passive senses, that you exist in a space.  
- **Spatialization**: The feeling that phenomena (especially your actions) exist in, and have an active effect on, objects in physical space.  
- **Embodiment**: The association between a representation of a body and the real body itself, created by continuous feedback between action and reaction within a physical body.  

Basis aims to offer these building blocks to creators.
